Todo:
1. Gantt Chart
2. Git project to organize and log everything!
3. Finish this writeup!

Previous Ideas:


Current Idea:
Low-cost stereoscopic (3D) clip on camera for glasses thats useful for VR content creation and lifelogging. DIY friendly and open source if possible (need to ask uni about this).

Features (Priority high to low):
1. Lightweight
2. Ease of use (clip design/storage) 
3. Battery clip on design (not built-in for more flexibility and ease of make)
4. Quality of 3D stereoscopic images/videos (resolution irrelevant but look for synchronisation and alignment, 3D effectiveness etc)
5. Video transfer method (preferably software/wireless, no need to take out sdcard each time), prioritize PC (for PCVR), then mobile if have time.
6. Surround sound system capture for immersiveness!
7. 360 degree video next if possible, if optimize for resolution, maybe have 2 main camera for forward view, and other camera just for immersion.
8. Modular design to fit use case!

Currently in research phase:
