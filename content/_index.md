**Welcome to My Portfolio: Exploring the Intersection of Innovation and Engineering**

Hey there! I'm [Muhammad Hazimi Bin Yusri](#about), a passionate 3rd Year MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at the [University of Southampton](#university). I'm excited to have you here, exploring my portfolio where I showcase my ongoing projects and accomplishments.

At the heart of my work is a relentless curiosity and a strong desire to be at the forefront of cutting edge technology. I combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills in personal projects like [fpv drone](#fpv-drone), [slimeVR full body tracking](#slimeVR), [home automation](#home-automation), and upgrading my home [work and play setup](#work-play-setup) once in a while. Through these experiences, I aim to push the boundaries of technology and create groundbreaking solutions.

I've always been interested in [programming](#programming) and its vast potential for personal assistance. While I initially explored scripting with Python during high school, I am now fascinated by the recent surge in AI interest and the remarkable capabilities of tools like [ChatGPT](#chatGPT). However, I recognize the importance of data security and integrity when working in a company setting, understanding the inevitable risks and the need for open-source alternatives.

Internships play a crucial role in shaping an engineer's career, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and expand my horizons. If you're searching for a dedicated and driven individual to join your team, I believe I can be a valuable asset. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me through the provided [contact information](https://chat.openai.com/#contact) to discuss potential collaborations or ask any questions.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited to explore potential opportunities and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Let's embark on this exciting engineering journey together!
