Home automation stuff using home-assistant. low priority writing completion.
Working so far, been 5 days or so.
consists of 2 smart bulb (cheap ebay chinese brand, uses magichome protocol), 1 raspberry pi camera (IR), 2 raspberry pi 3b+ (one for home-assistant OS, another for camera).

can be accessed remotely by port forwarding, however need to find out how to make sure the OS rasp pi keep same ip address when restarting to not mess up the port forwarding and keep it accessible when power outage/restart etc.

work progress: 80% done with what planned but need improvement and better automation scenes/scripting.
