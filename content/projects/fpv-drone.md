custom FPV drone built. medium priority writing completion

**To-do:**
1. Set Throttle limit to make it less powerful/easier to manage
2. Buy new ELRS diversity, GPS, and Buzzer module
3. Practice more in simulator
4. write the component list.

**Work progress:** 
was 90%, went down to 50% due to broken camera module (DJI O3 air unit) from flight 1, 
went up to 100% after repairs, 
then back to 70% due to broken modules (buzzer and gps) from flight 2 crash, and missing batteries as going back home to Malaysia and was scared to bring Li-Po together due to long flights and long transit, thus staying in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Kingdom, for a night.

2 Flights so far

**Flight 1:** /
Flew with fellow Soton FPV pilot, amazing fella, gave me great tips and tricks, and great spot as well. Learnt that my 6S drone is too powerful thus more sensitive to slight movement on controller.
Somehow broke my DJI O3 camera module (have no idea what causes it, probably due to impact and hard mount? using given mount which from AOS 5 V3 which is pretty bad). Also cut off nearly half of the ELRS Diversity antenna due to bad mounting position (the props cut it off), due to bad soldering (probably bad low quality solder as well which cause me to resolder it too much), the pad on the module also break, thankfully it was the TX pad so I still can control the drone, just no logging blackbox back to controller(?). Not so much good footage as I was flying Line Of Sight with Goggles off most of the time.

**Repair 1:**
At first, opened up the antenna and check for damage, none. Replaced with new DJI antenna, nope not working. Gave up repairing by myself and sent it for repair. Thankfully, after talking with DJI Customer Service, managed to get it fixed for free including postage as the camera is under warranty.

Next need better internal component isolation from elements (debris/grass etc) just to make it more clean/sleek. Better wire management needed, so I reroute most stuff and 3d printed a side cover for it.

I also got an amazing 3d design to mount the camera and GPS module from Tim O'Brien, his [discord](https://b.link/t4discord) server which I printed using TPU. This allow for soft mounting which also gives more stable video footage (less Jello effect).

Also added LED strip lights I have leftovers from my other projects (immersive lighting for back side of my monitors) which actually helps a lot for drone visibility especially during dusk.

Flight 2:
	Got some good footage, but I haven't yet setup the throttle limit (havent know about it yet atm), so still having hard time controlling the drone. Quite a lot of good footage, here's the compilation: https://youtu.be/KLsvO-GVh0s. Last crash cost me quite a lot. Apparently the ND filter I'm using is a bit too big than usual as well, thus I lost one of it after a crash as the magnetic only latch is not strong enough, would need the TPU mount to friction fit it as well.

TBC...
