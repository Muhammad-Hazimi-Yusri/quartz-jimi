Important conversation mainpoint:

1. **Project Definition and Scope**:
    
    - Goals and objective: Implement an affordable/low-cost, modular DIY stereo camera system.
    - Budget provided by uni: <£150 (this also defines low-cost)
    - Define the key features and functionality your camera system should have for VR content creation: refer [[quartz-jimi/content/projects/3rd-year-project/3rd-year-project|3rd-year-project]]
2. **Research and Background Study**:
    
    - Existing stereo camera system examples:
    -[Low cost stereo camera | Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/19533-low-cost-stereo-camera)
    -[StereoPi v2 | Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/stereopi/stereopi-v2#:~:text=StereoPi%20is%20an%20open-source%20stereoscopic%20camera%20based%20on,computer%20vision%2C%20drone%20instrumentation%2C%20panoramic%20video%2C%20and%20more.) 
    -[OpenCV AI Kit - Lite | Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/opencv-ai-kit-lite#/)
    -[Spectacles by Snap Inc. • The Next Generation of Spectacles](https://www.spectacles.com/uk/)
    - Research the hardware and software components typically used in such systems:
      USB camera (cheaper, more overhead in bandwidth and possibly more annoying protocol and driver) vs MIPI CSI-2 (easier driver, better quality and precision triggering for sync, but prob more expensive) https://youtu.be/8REu_h7bzHM
    - Understand the principles of stereo vision and how it applies to VR: most important is syncing the SBS (ipd? distance between camera and alignment), and the quality of both camera modules, and their camera settings to make sure both image/stills/video is as close as possible to each other
3. **Selecting Components**:
    
    - Choose the hardware components for your camera system (e.g., cameras, lenses, microcontrollers, sensors, etc.).
    - Consider cost-effective options without compromising quality.
    - Look into modular components that can be easily upgraded or replaced.
4. **Design and Prototyping**:
    
    - Create a detailed system architecture and design the modular aspects of your camera system.
    - Build a prototype to test your design and make improvements.
    - Document your design and development process thoroughly.
5. **Software Development**:
    
    - Develop the software required for capturing, processing, and storing stereo images.
    - Consider using open-source libraries and tools for VR content creation.
    - Implement calibration algorithms to ensure accurate stereo vision.
6. **Testing and Calibration**:
    
    - Rigorously test your camera system's functionality.
    - Calibrate the cameras and ensure they are synchronized correctly.
    - Assess the quality of stereo image pairs.
7. **Integration with VR Environment**:
    
    - Integrate your camera system with a VR environment or platform.
    - Develop or use software to render VR content from your stereo images.
    - Ensure compatibility with popular VR headsets.
8. **User Experience and Feedback**:
    
    - Gather feedback from potential users or VR content creators.
    - Make improvements based on their input.
9. **Cost Analysis and Optimization**:
    
    - Analyze the actual cost of your system compared to your budget.
    - Identify opportunities for cost optimization without compromising quality.
10. **Documentation and Final Report**:
    
    - Prepare a comprehensive final report documenting your project's details, including design, implementation, testing, and results.
    - Include clear diagrams, code samples, and any relevant data.
11. **Presentation**:
    
    - Prepare a presentation summarizing your project for your university evaluation.
12. **Future Work**:
    
    - Discuss potential future enhancements or extensions of your project.

Remember to maintain a detailed project plan, timeline, and keep track of your progress throughout the project. Also, consider seeking guidance from your academic advisor or professors as they can provide valuable insights and support. Good luck with your project! If you have specific questions or need assistance with any aspect of the project, feel free to ask.
